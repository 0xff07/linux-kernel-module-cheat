# Linux Kernel Module Cheat

Run one command, get into QEMU Buildroot BusyBox virtual machine with several minimal Linux kernel 4.9 module example tutorials with GDB and KGDB debug. Tested in x86 and ARM guests, Ubuntu 14.04 - 16.10 hosts.

Usage:

    sudo apt-get build-dep qemu
    ./run

First build will take a while (GCC, Linux kernel).

QEMU opens up, and you can run:

    root
    insmod /hello.ko
    insmod /hello2.ko
    rmmod hello
    rmmod hello2

This should print to the screen:

    hello init
    hello2 init
    hello cleanup
    hello2 cleanup

which are `printk` messages from `init` and `cleanup` methods of those modules.

Each module comes from a C file under `kernel_module/`. For module usage see:

    head kernel_module/modulename.c

Good bets inside guest are:

    /modulename.sh
    /modulename.out

After the first build, you can also run just:

    ./runqemu

to save a few seconds. `./run` wouldn't rebuild everything, but checking timestamps takes a few moments.

If you are feeling fancy, you can also insert modules with:

    modprobe hello

and if you are feeling raw, you can use:

    /myinsmod.out /hello.ko

We use `printk` a lot, and it shows on the QEMU terminal by default. If that annoys you (e.g. you want to see stdout separately), do:

    dmesg -n 1

We use Buildroot's default kernel version, you can confirm it after build with:

    grep BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_VERSION buildroot/.config

or in QEMU:

    cat /proc/version

## Text mode

Show serial output of QEMU directly on the current terminal, without opening a QEMU window:

    ./run -n

To exit, just do a regular:

    poweroff

This is particularly useful to get full panic traces when you start making the kernel crash :-) See also: <https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/208260/how-to-scroll-up-after-a-kernel-panic>

If the system crashes, you can't can quit QEMU with `poweroff`, but you can use either:

    Ctrl-C X

or:

    Ctrl-C A
    quit

## Debugging

To GDB the Linux kernel, first run:

    ./runqemu -d

This starts QEMU on the background of the shell, to prepare for running GDB.

If you want to break immediately at a symbol, e.g. `start_kernel` of the boot sequence, run:

    ./rungdb start_kernel

Now QEMU will stop there, and you can use the normal GDB commands:

    l
    n
    c

To skip the boot, run just:

    ./rungdb

and when you want to break, do `Ctrl + C` from GDB.

To have some fun, you can first run inside QEMU:

    /count.sh

which counts to infinity to stdout, and then in GDB:

    Ctrl + C
    break sys_write
    continue
    continue
    continue

And you now control the counting from GDB.

If you are using text mode:

    ./runqemu -d -n

QEMU cannot be put on the background of the current shell, so you will need to open a separate terminal and run:

    ./rungdb

`O=0` is however an impossible dream, `O=2` being the default: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29151235/how-to-de-optimize-the-linux-kernel-to-and-compile-it-with-o0> So get ready for some weird jumps, and `<value optimized out>` fun. Why, Linux, why.

### Kernel module debugging

Loadable kernel modules are a bit trickier since the kernel can place them at different memory locations depending on load other.

So we cannot set the breakpoints before `insmod`.

However, the Linux kernel GDB scripts offer the `lx-symbols` command, which takes care of that beautifully for us:

    ./runqemu -d
    ./rungdb

In QEMU:

    insmod /fops.ko

In GDB, hit `Ctrl + C`, and note how it says:

    scanning for modules in ../kernel_module-1.0/
    loading @0xffffffffa0000000: ../kernel_module-1.0//fops.ko

That's `lx-symbols` working! Now simply:

    b fop_write
    c

In QEMU:

    printf a >/sys/kernel/debug/lkmc_fops/f

and GDB now breaks at our `fop_write` function!

Just don't forget to remove your breakpoints after `rmmod`, or they will point to stale memory locations.

TODO: why does `break work_func` for `insmod kthread.ko` not break the first time I `insmod`, but breaks the second time?

#### Bypassing lx-symbols

Useless, but a good way to show how hardcore you are. From inside QEMU:

    insmod /fops.ko
    cat /proc/modules

This will give a line of form:

    fops 2327 0 - Live 0xfffffffa00000000

And then tell GDB where the module was loaded with:

    Ctrl + C
    add-symbol-file ../kernel_module-1.0/fops.ko 0xfffffffa00000000

## ARM

The portability of the kernel and toolchains is amazing.

If you already have an x86 build present, first:

    cd buildroot
    mv output output.x86~

First ARM build:

    ./run -a arm

Run without build:

    ./runqemu -a arm

Debug:

    ./runqemu -a arm -d
    # On another terminal.
    ./rungdb -a arm

ARM TODOs:

-   only managed to run in the terminal interface (but weirdly a blank QEMU window is still opened)
-   Ctrl + C kills the emulator, not sent to guest. See:
    - <https://github.com/cloudius-systems/osv/issues/49>
    - <https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/167165/how-to-pass-ctrl-c-in-qemu>
-   GDB not connecting to KGDB. Possibly linked to `-serial stdio`. See also: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14155577/how-to-use-kgdb-on-arm>

## KGDB

KGDB is kernel dark magic that allows you to GDB the kernel on real hardware without any extra hardware support.

It is useless with QEMU since we already have full system visibility with `-gdb`, but this is a good way to learn it.

Cheaper than JTAG (free) and easier to setup (all you need is serial), but with less visibility as it depends on the kernel working, so e.g.: dies on panic, does not see boot sequence.

Usage:

    ./runqemu -k
    ./rungdb -k

In GDB:

    c

In QEMU:

    /count.sh &
    /kgdb.sh

In GDB:

    b sys_write
    c
    c
    c
    c

And now you can count from GDB!

If you do: `b sys_write` immediately after `./rungdb -k`, it fails with `KGDB: BP remove failed: <address>`. I think this is because it would break too early on the boot sequence, and KGDB is not yet ready.

### KGDB kernel modules

In QEMU:

    /kgdb-mod.sh

In GDB:

    lx-symbols ../kernel_module-1.0/
    b fop_write
    c
    c
    c

and you now control the count.

TODO: if I `-ex lx-symbols` to the `gdb` command, just like done for QEMU `-gdb`, the kernel oops. How to automate this step?

### KDB

If you modify `runqemu` to use:

    -append kgdboc=kbd

instead of `kgdboc=ttyS0,115200`, you enter a different debugging mode called KDB.

Usage: in QEMU:

    [0]kdb> go

Boot finishes, then:

    /kgdb.sh

And you are back in KDB. Now you can:

    [0]kdb> help
    [0]kdb> bp sys_write
    [0]kdb> go

And you will break whenever `sys_write` is hit.

The other KDB commands allow you to instruction steps, view memory, registers and some higher level kernel runtime data.

But TODO I don't think you can see where you are in the kernel source code and line step as from GDB, since the kernel source is not available on guest (ah, if only debugging information supported full source).
